<h2>
  <b>Low and Slow</b>
</h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited <br>about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food <br>(usually vacum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath is precisely <br>set to the target temperature you want the <br>food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Porter describes it as <br>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <br><i>Sous Vide Salmon</i> with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat <br>at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
