    <h1>Linguine with Clam Sauce</h1>
    <p>
      "I don't know how authentic this recipe is, but it's quick and delicious. You can
      make it lactose-free by substituting a dairy-free margarine (we like Earth's
      Balance) for the butter. (Unfortunately, butter is better.) This recipe serves 2."

        "Open the cans of clams and use the lid to squeeze out the liquid into a 2-cup
        measuring cup. Set the clams aside you usually get about 1 1/2 cups of liquid.
        Add wine to the liquid until you have a total of 2 cups liquid."

        translucent. Add the garlic (the more the better) and saute until fragrant, but
        not brown (just under a minute)."

        the pasta to the water and cook until al dente. About 9 minutes later, the pasta
        should be done and the clams will be warmed through."

        "Taste the clam sauce and salt and pepper to taste. If you're using butter,
        add one last tablespoon or two to bind the sauce (if you're using margarine,
        don't bother)."
